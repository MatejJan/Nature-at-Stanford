	<h4>Spend 5 seconds to feel the connection with raw food</h4>
	<p>Iâ€™m doing a #naturefoodeveryday challenge where we take a moment to appreciate nature for providing us with amazing food. To join me in this challenge, take a picture of the raw materials before you cook your meal, spend a few seconds to feel the connection with what nature gives us, and pass it on to your food enthusiast friends.</p>
